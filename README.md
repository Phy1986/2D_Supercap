This repository accompanies the manuscript "Electrolyte Hydration Energy as a Universal Descriptor for Ion-Specific Capacitance". It provides code, data, and analysis tools to reproduce the interpretable machine learning framework for predicting and understanding the capacitance of 2D MoS₂ supercapacitors. Try our Hugging Face Space to predict capacitance by inputting features directly:
 
Explore how 1T content, d-spacing, and other features influence capacitance predictions in real time. Simply:
1.	Input values for MoS₂ properties, electrolyte parameters, fabrication details, and operational conditions.
2.	Click Predict to see the model’s capacitance output.
